Real-world data analyst portfolio project based on an e-commerce inventory dataset scraped from Zepto — one of India’s fastest-growing quick-commerce startups. This project simulates real analyst workflows, from raw data exploration to business-focused data analysis.
The goal is to simulate how actual data analysts in the e-commerce or retail industries work behind the scenes to use SQL to:

✅ Set up a messy, real-world e-commerce inventory database

✅ Perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to explore product categories, availability, and pricing inconsistencies

✅ Implement Data Cleaning to handle null values, remove invalid entries, and convert pricing from paise to rupees

✅ Write business-driven SQL queries to derive insights around pricing, inventory, stock availability, revenue and more
